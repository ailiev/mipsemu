Trying to figure out whether the dietlibc implementation of malloc is good
(simpple?) enough for us.
It calls syscalls:
- mmap (with MAP_ANONYMOUS, and no file-related stuff)

so, I need to implement an mmap syscall which finds and returns a (largish)
pointer to heap memory.


mystery: where does the call to __small_malloc from _alloc_libc_malloc (in
alloc.c) end up in the binary? In the objdump disassembly, __small_malloc is not
listed for some reason, but it is right after error_unified_syscall (perhaps
this is because it's a file-local/static function)

Initialization of $sp in __start:
- it appears to start out with some value, it's not fully initialized in
  __start.
- mask out some bits with mask -8, which is bit pattern 0xFFFFFFF8, ie. bits 0-2
are masked out.
- subtract 24 from it
- ie: $sp should be initialized before the program runs.
