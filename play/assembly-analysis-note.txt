__start uses $t9 to call main, and then call _exit:
lui	t9,0x40
addiu	t9,t9,<small offset>
jalr	t9


the data area:
the compiler has set it up, in the elf file,  with the values of globals. Starts
around 0x10000000, but specified in the elf file.

We know the .data size from the elf file, so right above it can begin the heap.

seciotn .bss contains the unitialized global variables (errno and environ in
this case). The length of .bss recorded in the ELF is way too long - 544 bytes,
whereas only 8 bytes worth of symbols point in there. may need to run the
program to find out if it does poke deeper into bss for something (too hard to
try to decode all its memory accesses by hand)
