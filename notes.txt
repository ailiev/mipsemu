How to get a list of all instructions used in an objdump disassembly:
> mipsel-linux-objdump -d simple | pcregrep '^\s+(\d|[a-f])+:' | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq

and a list of all the binary instructions:
mipsel-linux-objdump -d simple | pcregrep '^\s+(\d|[a-f])+:' | awk '{print $2}'


register usage: both rt and rd are used as result registers in instruction
formats, depending on whether rt is used for an operand too.

We're ignoring overflow exceptions for now, just doing signed and unsigned
arithmetic instructions identically.
