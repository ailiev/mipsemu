Make sure you have obtained the binutils, gcc and dietlibc sources, using
../../download.sh.

Edit env.sh to change the root installation directory if needed. The target
should be fine as is.

Run the install-all.sh script.

At the end, the mipsel-linux tools will be in $rootdir/


If there are any problems, look into the install-all.sh and try the offending
steps by hand.


NOTE: Makefile-dietlibc is a slightly patched version of the dietlibs Makefile,
to use the mipsel-linux cross compiler, and not the mips-linux one as they
originally had:
