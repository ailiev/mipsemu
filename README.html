<h1>MIPS Emulator</h1>

This is a simple MIPS emulator, which can run programs written in C and:
<ul>
  <li>compiled with the GNU toolchain (<code>gcc</code>, <code>binutils</code>) targeting little-endian MIPS, and</li>
  <li>linked statically with a MIPS build of <code>dietlibc</code>
</ul>

<p>

Apart from intergration with existing toolchains, the emulator features a pluggable RAM implementation.
<p>
Its main purpose is to build a prototype Oblivious RAM system, by plugging in a RAM implementation which implements an oblivious RAM algorithm.

<h2>Installing</h2>
See <a href="INSTALL.html" >INSTALL</a>.


<h2>Compiling MIPS executables</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>

  <li> A cross-compilation toolchain targeting MIPS. A skeleton is set up in
  <code>BASEDIR/src/crossgcc/</code>. The README file there points to the script
  to download the sources for a gcc-based toolkit, and build it. Don't forget to
  add the directory with the executables (compiler, linker, assembler etc.) to
  the PATH.

  <li> A <em>dietlibc</em> installation, which is built and installed as part of
  the cross-compilation toolkit above.

  </ul>

  <h3>Make utilities</h3>
  
 The makefile <code>mips-shared.make</code> has rules for compiling and linking
C files using the cross-compilation tools and dietlibc. Include it into your own
makefile, and just specify some object files to compile (without an explicit
compile command) and the executable to link, using the <code>$(LD)</code>
(linker) variable exported by mips-shared.make. This is illustrated in the
sample <code>play/Makefile</code>.


<h2>Using the emulator</h2>

Once the MIPS program is compiled, run it using <code>runmips</code>. The first
parameter must be the MIPS ELF executable to run. Most of the remaining parameters are
passed to the MIPS program.
<p>

  <h3>RAM implementations</h3>

  The emulator has two ways to configure a RAM implementation.
  <p>
  If using dynamic linking, the implementation is specified by a command line parameter <code>-m</code>, eg:
  <pre>
$ runmips -m libmemory-impl-simple.so mipsexe
</pre>
<p>
  If dynamic linking is not available, eg. when running the MIPS emulator in the
4758 secure coprocessor, the RAM impl can be selected at compilation, and linked
together with the emulator. The Makefile describes how to do this. In this case,
there is no need to supply a RAM impl parameter when running, and it will be ignored if given.
  <p>
  Two RAM implementations are available currently:
  
  <ul>
    <li> <code>libmemory-impl-simple.so</code> which implements the RAM as a simple byte array
      on the native host.
    <li><code>libmemory-impl-ppirw.so</code> which is produced by the ORAM module (see <a href="../oram/README.html" >README</a>) and implements the RAM using the Oblivious RAM /
      PIR/W algorithm from our PIR.W system.
    <p>
    This requires the standard PIR/W
      setup, where the MIPS emulated CPU is in the secure coprocessor, and it
      uses a server (card_server) running on the host for storage of bulk data.
      See <a href="../sfdl-runtime/README.html">Circuit virtual machine
README</a> for details on this setup.

    </li>
  </ul>
  

<h2>Sample programs</h2>
Look inside the <code>play/</code> directory.

  <h2>Limitations</h2>

  Fairly few syscalls are supported. Currently supported are:
  <ul>
    <li><code>mmap(2)</code>, which enables use of <code>malloc</code> etc.</li>

    <li><code>read(2)</code> and <code>write(2)</code>, which allow quite
flexible I/O, including <code>printf</code> if the code-size overhead is
acceptable. This is limited to the console for now, as <code>open(2)</code> is
not implemented.</li>

</ul>
